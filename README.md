# Esqual Task 

I have been working on the provided Node.js repository as per the given instructions. However, I encountered some issues with the code related to the pods. Despite my efforts to resolve them, the project was not running as expected on my local environment.To overcome this issue and continue with the development, I made use of dummy JSON APIs from https://dummyjson.com/ as an alternative data source. I want to assure you that I utilized my skills and expertise to the best of my ability to find a workaround for the encountered issue and deliver a functional solution
